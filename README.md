# Simplified-Autocomplete
In this class project, I was tasked to implement a simplified version of an autocomplete function. This project finds the top matches of words based on a given query string and large files with terms that have weights attached to them which could signify the number of times this word was searched. When given a query string, the program finds all of the terms in the files that has this query in it and extracts it, it then gets sorted by weight and the top matches.
